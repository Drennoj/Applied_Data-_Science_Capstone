    "Perhaps one the most diverse groupings of food available is the sandwich. In the United States you can find thousands of variations with some being famous nationwide or representing a geographic area as the signature sandwich (ex. Philly Cheesesteak). There are dozens of chains specializing in sandwiches, however, few of these chains hold the appeal of local favorites who create loyal customers who will argue for hours on end about whether their favorite sandwich shop is better than the one across the street. \n",
