    "We will start by scraping Wikipedia to create a dataframe with the zipcodes and neighborhoods from Toronto. Once this is completed we will then be able to pull the geographic coordinates for each neighborhood using Nominatim from the Geopy library. Using the coordinates we will pull venue data from the Foursquare API to identify what neighborhoods are already saturated with sandwich shops vs. those with potential opportunity to be a unique option for locals.
